# THM 3 September

Completed this certification yesterday so this is a late entry.

I do not have much to say aside from I am already familiar with 90% of the content. The other 10% was a mix of actually new things, a refresh of what I already know or additional details of topics I am already somewhat familiar with.

The most notable thing are the new Linux commands I picked up like crontabs and background/foreground processes.

Onwards to the Offensive Security Learning Path or the Cyber Defense.
