# Tryhackme (28 July 2021)

At the time of writing this, I am about 80% done with Tryhackme's CompTIA Pentest+.
This document will detail my experience thus far. Formatting will get better as I understand markdown more and maybe I'll document the rooms that I had done previously.

To start, the many modules or rooms in this learning path has helped me reinforce the basics.
Not just at the 'enumeration' stage which would be the one that most people would think of when it comes to performing any hacktivities, but I am referring to before that.

In the earlier days of the learning path, I was rather clumsy with setting my environment. At some point, I spent 3-4 hours trying to nmap the machine that Tryhackme provided before I realise I was not even connected to the Tryhackme VPN. In my defense, I was distracted at the time but because of that experience, I now double check myself everytime I am about to do any attacks on the given machines.

I have also started to get used to document each steps more. For example, using nmap's -oN flag to save any output and then using grep to find the ports open quickly. One thing I am somewhat giddy and proud about is that I am starting to understand using Metasploit more. The first Metasploit room that Tryhackme provided was somewhat difficult and confusing. I had to refer other sources often to use it.

In the Network Services 2 room, I managed to use Metaspoloit without referring to external sources (I did refer to Metasploit's own room because I forgot how to execute an exploit)
and mostly solved the SMTP room by myself.

Another experience worth mentioning is the difficulty in getting a bash binary to run for privilege escalation. In the NFS module, it was required to download a bash file from Github
for privilege escalation. I struggled to get it running partly due to my weak understanding of SUID on files and also wget being seemingly broken.

The difficulty led to me referring to online videos on how people solved it and even that did not help let me complete the room properly. It was then I realized I could just try to
download the bash file directly instead of using wget and it did work. Upon some researching, my guess on why I could not get it to run is due to wget corrupting the download somehow
although the reason for that is unclear.

On a final note, I still struggle to understand how the Vulnversity exploit really worked so I will definitely need to read the writeup for that room.
